      <p>Portfolio in Progress

I am currently building my portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments. While it’s still a work in progress, I’ve made significant strides in creating a professional and engaging space that reflects my growth as a developer. I’m working on refining the design and structure, focusing on providing a seamless user experience.

Although I am still figuring out some technical details, like how to import images and set up a working contact form that sends emails, I’m proud of the progress made so far. The portfolio will continue to evolve as I finalize these features, and I’m excited to share it when it’s ready for full display.
