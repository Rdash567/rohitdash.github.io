    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a high school student who has a strong enthusiasm for technology, particularly in the fields of computer science, computer engineering, and computer hardware. My journey started with a keen interest in problem-solving, which propelled me to excel in programming with Java and Python, as well as work well with computer hardware. I thrive on challenges and am dedicated to using my skills to innovate and bring about positive change in the world.

        Looking ahead to college, I eagerly anticipate immersing myself in a challenging academic environment that will further develop my technical abilities, particularly in computer hardware, and foster creativity. With a growth mindset and a determination to push boundaries, I am enthusiastic about collaborating, learning, and making a significant impact in the technology sector.</p>
